I will be creating a Rock-Paper-Scissors game clone here
to test and develop Javascript skills.
Later on, HTML and CSS will be added.
For now, the game will be run from the console.

The original idea for the project, from The Odin Project,
can be found here:

The game will be played against the computer.
Since I've done some practicing on my own with Javascript,
I don't feel this will be too challenging,
but am still looking forward to figuring out the exact functions.
